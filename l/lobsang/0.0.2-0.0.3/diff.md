+A directive's scope is one user message, and it's corresponding response from the LLM.
 The directive embeds a user message with instructions for the LLM to follow.
 Once the LLM generated a response, the directive will parse the response according to the directive's context.
 
 For example, a JSONDirective will embed specific instructions for the LLM to follow and to return a JSON response.
 Since, the LLM only returns text, the JSONDirective will try to parse the response as JSON and return the result.
